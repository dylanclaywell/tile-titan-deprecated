# Tile Titan

Tile Titan is a simple web app that allows you to create and export tilemaps for use in game development or other similar projects.

## Features

### Export project to a zip file

You can export your project to a zip file in Tile Titan. This is useful if you want to share your project with others or use it in another project.

### Import project from a zip file

Tile Titan allows you to import an existing project from a zip file. This is useful if you want to continue working on a previously created tilemap.

### Uploading tilesets

Tile Titan allows you to upload your own tilesets. Simply select the tileset file from your local machine and it will be added to the project.

### Creating tile layers

With Tile Titan, you can create tile layers for your tilemap. This allows you to easily add tiles to your map and create a visually appealing design.

### Creating object layers

Object layers can also be created in Tile Titan. Object layers are used to add non-tile objects to your map, such as NPCs or interactive objects.

### Creating structure layers

Finally, Tile Titan allows you to create structure layers. Structure layers are used to add structural elements to your map, such as walls, bridges, or other architectural elements.
